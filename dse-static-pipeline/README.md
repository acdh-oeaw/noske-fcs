# dse-static pipiline

Set of sccripts:

* `create_verticals.py`: harvests Peter Andorfer's [dse-static](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw?q=dse-static&type=all&language=&sort=) TEI-XML digital editions,
tokenizes and enriches them with lemma and part of speach and generates (No)Sketch Engine-compatible [vertical files](https://www.sketchengine.eu/glossary/vertical-file/) and corresponding [corpus config files](https://www.sketchengine.eu/documentation/the-corpus-configuration-file/) as well as corpora config files in the format used by the [noske-fcs](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs).
* `compile_corp.sh`: creates binary indices from the vertical files (by calling the `compilecorp` binary from the `czcorpus/kontext-manatee:2.225.8-noble` docker image).
* `build_image.sh`: builds a Docker image containing data generated by the `create_verticals.py` and the `compile_corp.sh`.

## Usage

### As a github action

* Go to https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs/actions/workflows/dse-static.yml and run the workflow.
  It will read the data from the existing `acdhch/noske-fcs-dse-static` image, run the `create_verticals.py`, `compile_corp.sh` and `build_image.sh` and push the resulting image to the registry.
* Update the [corpora.yaml](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs/blob/main/corpora.yaml) with the data of the generated corpora
  (you can find them in the `data/*.yml` files), commit and push.
* Run the [build action](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs/actions/workflows/build.yml) or make a new release.

### By hand

* Clone this repo and go into directory with this file
* Install Python dependencies
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate
  pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```
  * If you want to use the [spacy](https://spacy.io/) (and not the [udppipe](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/)),
    you need to install it along with language models of your choice.
    Please take a look at the https://spacy.io/usage#quickstart for details
    but it will go down to something like (in already activated python virtual environment):
    ```bash
    pip3 install -U spacy
    python -m spacy download LangModuleOfYourChoice
    ```
* Create the config file from a template:
  ```bash
  cp config_sample.yaml config.yaml
  ````
  and adjust the `config.yaml` contents
* Optionally extract already existing data
  ```bash
  ./extract_existing.sh
  ```
* Run with
  ```bash
  python3 create_verticals.py
  ```
  * To see all command-line options run
    ```bash
    python3 create_verticals.py --help
    ```
* Then run
  ```bash
  ./compile_corp.sh
  ./build_image.sh
  docker push acdhch/noske-fcs-dse-static
  ```
* Update the [corpora.yaml](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs/blob/main/corpora.yaml) with the data of the generated corpora
  (you can find them in the `data/*.yml` files), commit and push.
* Run the [build action](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/noske-fcs/actions/workflows/build.yml) or make a new release.
